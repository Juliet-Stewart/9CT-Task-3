## Phase 1: Identifying and Defining
### Mind Map()
### Defining Purpose
*"Australia's temperatures have been rising over the last two decades."*
### Requirements Outline
**Functional Requirements**
* **Data Loading** - *The system must be able to load common file types like .csv, .xlsx, and .json without breaking.*
* **Data Cleaning** - *Ensure it is easy for the user to sort through and filter through the different data sets they wish to view.*
* **Data Analysis** - *The system should be able to produce things like mean, median, mode, min, and max for the data.*
* **Data Visualisation** - *The data must be able to be displayed in a format that is visually appealing and easy to understand.*
* **Data Reporting** - *The system should create a simple summary that shows the key findings clearly and lets you save the final results if needed.*

**Non-Functional Requirements**
* **Usability** - *Ensure the UI is easy to understand and the required inputs are made known to the user.*
* **Security** - *Adding a username and password requirement would be a very small and simple step but would greatly increase the security of the data.*

## Phase 2: Researching and Planning
### SEE-I Paragraph
Sources across the internet all point to Australia's climate increasing in temperature year by year. And there is no denying this fact, when it is backed by pure numbers and statistics. A site from the NSW government states that "Australia's average temperature has increased on average by 1.44 ± 0.24 °C since national records began in 1910." This fact is also backed up by the Beuro of Meteorology. While this may not seem much, at the rate we're going, we expect to see an increase of almmost 2.5 degrees by 2050. And that number will just keep getting bigger and bigger. 40 degree days will become much less of a rarity.

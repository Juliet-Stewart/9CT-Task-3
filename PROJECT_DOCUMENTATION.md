## Phase 1: Identifying and Defining
### Mind Map
### Defining Purpose
### Requirements Outline
**Functional Requirements**
* **Data Loading** - *The system must be able to load common file types like .csv, .xlsx, and .json without breaking.*
* **Data Cleaning** - *Ensure it is easy for the user to sort through and filter through the different data sets they wish to view.*
* **Data Analysis** - *The system should be able to produce things like mean, median, mode, min, and max for the data.*
* **Data Visualisation** - *The data must be able to be displayed in a format that is visually appealing and easy to understand.*
* **Data Reporting** - *The system should create a simple summary that shows the key findings clearly and lets you save the final results if needed.*

**Non-Functional Requirements**
* **Usability** - *Ensure the UI is easy to understand and the required inputs are made known to the user.*
* **Security** - *Adding a username and password requirement would be a very small and simple step but would greatly increase the security of the data.*

**Use Case**
